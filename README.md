# project\_recommendations\_ibm

Recommendations\_with\_IBM\_submit.ipynb is the final version. Debugged and refactored. 

### TODO
- Documentation / Explanation.
- Deployment to an app.

### Approach

- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Rank Based Recommendations
- User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
- Content Based Recommendations (EXTRA - NOT REQUIRED)
- Matrix Factorization
- Extras & Concluding

### Known Issues
There are some function order sequence related issues that might require re-order positions of functions
in order to run sequentially in a notebook. 

Otherwise, I need to manually jump up and down in the notebook file to 
execute functions that required by some callers. 

Further refactoring required.
